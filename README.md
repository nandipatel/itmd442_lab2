## Project Description:
This is a simple contact database. The goal of this application is to let users be able to do the CRUD function within the database.

## Development Environment:
I have a Macbook Pro, the macOS is Ventura 13.2.1. The node.js version I used was v16.13.0. I used visual studio code as the editor, version 1.75.1.

## Installation/Running Instructions:
1. Clone the GitHub Repository
2. Update your dependencies by enter "npm-check-updates" in your terminal
3. Once all updates are done, open the repository
4. In the GitHub Application or Visual Studio Code, open a terminal (will be in the menubar)
5. Once the terminal is open enter the following: node index.js, which will lead you to the home page

## Insights and Results:
I learned html in pug format, along with some rendering features. I faced problems in getting pages to load, it was saying that it cannot 'GET' the page. I tried different method to fix the error but wasn't able to. In the end, I added code to the pages, but they didn't load, so I wasn't able to test much. I think I missed a couple of steps, in the backend from getting, the application from working.
